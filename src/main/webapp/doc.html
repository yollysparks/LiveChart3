            <h3> Design </h3>
            <p>     We made sure we met everyday and see how to work on our project since we did not see a reason to split the project into two,
                    We took more time in our project since we were only two of us we had to give it all the time we had to make sure we complete the CA.
                    Our system is composed of a Server class which listens on port 8081 for any incoming connections. When it receives one,
                    it instantiates a new instance of the class ClientHandler, that has a reference to the socket of the newly connected
                    client and the server itself. Once a user telnets in , an instance of the Client class is created,
                    which listens for messages from the server. For it to update the GUI, we have used a compositional relationship between
                    the GUI class and the Client class. Handling of messages from the client 
                    is handled by the ClientMessageHandler, and messages from the server is handled by the ClientHandler.</p>

            <h3> How we worked.  </h3>
            <p>
                Since we were two members (Felesiah and Marco) in our group we worked together  both on the code and the documentation that was the best way 
                we found we could work on our CA. Also it made it possible for us to help each other when we were stuck on the code.
